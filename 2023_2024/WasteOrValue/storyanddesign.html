                        <h4>Story</h4>
                        <p>Just as any other Mario Game, Super Mario Bros Wonder starts with a simple story.
                            Mario, the main character, Luigi, his brother, Princess Peach, Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Daisy, Princess of the Sarasaland, the Yellow Toad, the Blue Toad and Toadette are invited to the Flower Kingdom, a neighbor to the Mushroom Kingdom, Ruled by Prince Florian.
                            Prince Florian starts with showing off the Wonder Flower to his visitors, when suddenly, Bowser, the main villain of nearly any Mario Game, Bowser Jr., his son and Kamek, a magical Koopa that is also the servant of Bowser, arrive.
                            Bowser takes hold of the Wonder Flower, merging him, his Koopa Clown Car, which is Bowsers vehicle he uses to move to distant spots, and Florian‘s Castle, the Flower Castle, to become Castle Bowser, who spreads havoc across the entire kingdom, including trapping the kingdom‘s inhabitants, the Poplins, small Toad-like creatures, in their homes.
                            Not wanting to let this stand, Mario and company eagerly decide to help save the Flower Kingdom and with Florian, four Yoshis, dino-like creatures that can eat any enemy and can be used by Mario or others to ride them, and Nabbit,
                            a purple rabbit that usually steals from toad houses in other Mario Games but plays as an invincible character that can‘t use items just like the Yoshis, to set off to stop Bowser‘s plans once again.</p>

                        <h4>Artstyle</h4>
                        <p>Super Mario Bros Wonder is a beautiful game, because it revolutionized the artstyle. Usual mario games were already known for their great graphics, in comparison to Super Mario Bros Wonder though, they look a bit lifeless. To make this more clear, Super Mario Bros Wonder uses lots of new techniques to make the game more appealing. One thing is that all the characters and enemies now have expressions on their face. For example, if you start running, mario makes a more angry face than if he would stay still or just walk. Also the game is more colorful, the objects have more textures, and everything just uses more parallax.</p>
