                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Here you can inform yourself about the aspects bossfights, difficulty and how to get 100% on the game.</h3>
                    <div class="text-section">
                        <h3>Bossfights</h3>
                        <h4>In Mario Wonder you will fight bosses a total of five times. The battleships are not included in this list.</h4>
                        <p>1. The first bossfight is finding its place in the Castle of Pipe-Rock Plateau. You compete against Bowser Jr. In this fight he uses a magic spell to change the sizes of himself and Mario. You can use this to your andvantage, when you get bigger. Bowser Jr. will turn small and you won‘t have any trouble stomping him.</p>
                        <p>2. After that you will meet Bowser Jr. once again. Although this time, he switches the ground to the states of slippery and sticky while the ground moves up and down.</p>
                        <p>3. At the third bossfight, you will see Bowser Jr. once again. This time, Bowser Jr. will flood the room with water, where you will have to defeat him while swimming.</p>
                        <p>4. In this bossfight, you meet Bowser Jr. just as in any other bossfight until now. This time Bowser Jr. uses his magical powers to make the fight into a silhouette style. Bowser Jr. uses this to his advantage as he hides behind bushes and pillars, wich makes it hard for Mario to see him.</p>
                        <p>5. Last but not least in the last bossfight of the game, mario stumbles upon Bowser himself, the father of Bowser Jr. This fight uses a rhythmic playing mechanic, as the ground lifts in sync with the music that is playing in the background. If timed correctly, Mario gets a jump-boost that will help him hit the switch beneath bowsers head.</p>

                        <h3>Difficulty</h3>
                        <p>Just as expected and just like any other typical mario game, Super Mario Bros Wonder, despite all of its new enemies, bossfights and game mechanics, is not that hard to beat.
                            Although this game has a difficulty ranking at the start of every level, the levels won‘t get that hard, even at five stars, wich is the highest the difficulty can get.
                            Features like the backpack, which is used to hold items that you can’t use at that moment of time or to save for later, make it almost a bit too easy. There are also the new badges, you can collect through the game, these will make you glide, jump higher and further, double jump or even use a rank to pull you to the next wall.
                            This might sound good in the first place, but they will also make you a bit too overpowered, which in the end just makes you finish almost every level at your first try. This is going to steal your challenge and most players fun.</p>

                    <div class="text-section">
                        <h3>100%</h3>
                        <p>To 100% the Game, you will need to complete 6 requirements. Firstly you will need to find each level‘s purple 10-Coin. These big coins are worth 10 purple coins, as the name suggests. When you reach W5, you will get a special sensor badge that will notify you when a 10-Coin is near, this will help you and speed up the process of finding all the coins. Secondly you will have to collect every Wonder Seed. Most normal levels have two of them, but mini-challenges and shops will each give you at least 1 too. Third you will have to buy every standee. You can find these in normal shops where you can buy them for 10 coins each, however there is another shop in the special world that lets you buy one category of standees for 30 coins, so we would recommend saving your coins. Fourth you will need to hit every flagpoles top. This might be one of the easiest tasks, as most levels fortunately make this easy to do, if you’re still having trouble hitting them, you could use items like high-jump-badges or the floating-hat-badge. Fifth you will have to collect every badge. In total there are 24 badges spread across the game. To collect them, you will need to find all poplin-houses and you some of them must be bought in the poplin shop. And lastly, the sixth requirement, you will clearly have to finish the game.</p>
