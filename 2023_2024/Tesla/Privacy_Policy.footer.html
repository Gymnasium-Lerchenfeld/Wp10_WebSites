            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <h3>Customer Privacy Notice</h3>
            <p>Your privacy is and will always be enormously important to us. Our Privacy Notice is designed to provide transparency into our data practices in a format that is easy to read and navigate. Please read the sections below to understand how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information in order to offer you the most seamless vehicle and energy experience imaginable.</p>

            <h3>Privacy From Day One</h3>
            <p>Your Tesla generates vehicle, diagnostic, infotainment system, and Autopilot data. To protect your privacy from the moment you take delivery, Tesla does not associate the vehicle data generated by your driving with your identity or account by default. As a result, no one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location or a history of where you’ve been. Your in-vehicle experiences are also protected. From features such as voice commands, to surfing the web on your touchscreen, your information is kept private and secure, ensuring the infotainment data collected is not linked to your identity or account.

                Tesla vehicles are equipped with a camera suite designed from the ground up to protect your privacy while providing advanced features such as Autopilot, Smart Summon, and Autopark. To recognize things like lane lines, street signs and traffic light positions, Autopilot data from the camera suite is processed directly without leaving your vehicle by default. In order for camera recordings for fleet learning to be shared with Tesla, your consent for Data Sharing is required and can be controlled through the vehicle’s touchscreen at any time. Even if you choose to opt-in, unless we receive the data as a result of a safety event (a vehicle collision or airbag deployment) — camera recordings remain anonymous and are not linked to you or your vehicle.
                
                Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, your Energy products are designed to protect your privacy. Tesla aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary for displaying your in-app energy experience, providing services to you, and for improving your energy products. We are also committed to only share your personal data when needed to operate or service your product, or we will ask for your permission.</p>
